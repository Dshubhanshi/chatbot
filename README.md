# chatbot

def greet():: This function defines a greeting message for the chatbot.

def respond(response):: This function takes a user input response as an argument and generates a response based on the input.

Inside the respond() function:

response = response.lower(): This line converts the user input to lowercase to make the response case-insensitive.
The function checks various conditions in the user's input using if and elif statements and provides corresponding responses. For example:
If the user input contains "hello" or "hi", the chatbot responds with a greeting.
If the user asks "how are you?", the chatbot responds that it's just a computer program and thanks the user for asking.
If the user asks for the chatbot's name, the chatbot responds with "hii i am somuuuunnnnn".
If the user asks for the purpose of the chatbot, the chatbot responds that it's built for a CodeAlpha internship project.
If the user says "bye" or "goodbye", the chatbot bids farewell.
If none of the above conditions are met, the chatbot responds with a default message indicating that it doesn't understand the input.
The if __name__ == "__main__": block:

It executes the greet() function to greet the user when the program starts.
It starts an infinite loop where the chatbot continuously prompts the user for input.
If the user inputs "exit", the chatbot prints a farewell message and exits the loop, thus ending the program.
Otherwise, it passes the user input to the respond() function to generate a response and prints the chatbot's response.
